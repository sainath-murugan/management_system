# management_system

This project is developed by python library "django". It is a management app to place the customer's order.I have used many classes and methods in django to make the website more dynamic.
Read below to view the specification of the website ðŸ‘‡

# features in the website

* registeration
* Good login/out feature
* Password reset feature
* User profile page with image
* Backend works
* AWS RDS database
* Deployment in Heroku

# REGISTERATION
   I have created a form class in `form.py` file and implemented the form in registeration page to create User with django class `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`. It is used to create a customer id.
 
 ``` python
 
 class CreateUserForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["username", "email", "password1", "password2"]
```

# Login/Logout
   I have created a good login/out feature in this project so the customer can logout and login any time. If the user is already logged in they can't visit the login page again.

``` python

@unauthenticated_user
def login_user(request):
    
        if request.method == "POST":
            username = request.POST.get("username")
            password = request.POST.get("password")
            user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
            if user is not None:
                login(request, user)
                return redirect("home")
            else:
                messages.info(request, "user name or password is incorrect")
        return render(request, "accounts/login_form.html")

@login_required(login_url="login")
def logout_user(request):
    logout(request)
    return redirect("login")
```
