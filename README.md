# management_system

This project is developed by python library "django". It is a management app to place the customer's order.I have used many classes and methods in django to make the website more dynamic.
Read below to view the specification of the website ðŸ‘‡

# features in the website

* registeration
* Good login/out feature
* Password reset feature
* User profile page with image
* Backend works
* AWS RDS database and s3 bucket
* Deployment in Heroku
* Specification of website

# REGISTERATION
   I have created a form class in `form.py` file and implemented the form in registeration page to create User with django class `from django.contrib.auth.models import User`. It is used to create a customer id.
 
 ``` python
 
 class CreateUserForm(UserCreationForm):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ["username", "email", "password1", "password2"]
```

# Login/Logout
   I have created a good login/out feature in this project so the customer can logout and login any time. If the user is already logged in they can't visit the login page again.

``` python

@unauthenticated_user
def login_user(request):
    
        if request.method == "POST":
            username = request.POST.get("username")
            password = request.POST.get("password")
            user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
            if user is not None:
                login(request, user)
                return redirect("home")
            else:
                messages.info(request, "user name or password is incorrect")
        return render(request, "accounts/login_form.html")

@login_required(login_url="login")
def logout_user(request):
    logout(request)
    return redirect("login")
```

# Password reset
  Django provides a good password reset capability by email. I have implemented the feature in this project so the user can reset their password when they want.
  
  ``` python
    from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
    
    
    path("reset_password", auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view(template_name="accounts/reset_password.html"), name="reset_password"),
    path("reset_password_sent", auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(template_name="accounts/reset_password_sent.html"), name="password_reset_done"),
    path("reset/<uidb64>/<token>/", auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(template_name="accounts/reset_password_email.html"), name="password_reset_confirm"),
    path("reset_password_complete", auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(template_name="accounts/password_reset_complete.html"), name="password_reset_complete")
 ```
# User profile page
  
  I have created a sepreate template for user profile page. so the customer can update their detail anytime the can with profile picture. The customer can update their detail by ` CustomerForm` class in form.py file.
  
  ``` python
@login_required(login_url="login")
@allowed_users(allowed=["customer"])
def account_setting(request):
    customer = request.user.customer 
    form = CustomerForm(instance=customer)
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = CustomerForm(request.POST, request.FILES, instance=customer)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
    return render(request, "accounts/account_setting.html",{"form":form})
 ```

# Backend Works
   I have used many classes and method to make the website more dynamic such as, i have used `django-filter==2.4.0` to make the search very easier to the admin.
 I have created a sepreate `decarators.py` file and created `unauthenticated_user`, `allowed_users`, `admin_only` classes to make the login and regiteration feature more efficeint.
 
 I have also used signals to make the communication better
 
  ``` python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Customer
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group

def customer_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
     if created:
        group = Group.objects.get(name = "customer")
        instance.groups.add(group)
        Customer.objects.create(user=instance, name=instance.username)

post_save.connect(customer_profile, sender=User)
 ```
# AWS RDS database and s3 bucket
   I have created a Postgresql database in AWS and connected it with my django app. so, the user's data can be stoed in live rds.
   And i have created a s3 bucket to store the static and image file in aws and it is controlled by `boto3==1.17.49`, `django-storages==1.11.1`.
   
   ``` python
#aws

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = os.getenv("AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME")
AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = "%s.s3.amazonaws.com" % AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    "CacheControl": "max-age=86400"
}
AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = None
AWS_S3_FILE_OVERWRITE = False

#s3 static setting
AWS_LOCATION = 'static'
STATIC_URL = "https://%s/%s/" %(AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN, AWS_LOCATION)
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "webapp.storage_backends.StaticStorage"



#s3 public media setting
PUBLIC_MEDIA_LOCATION = "images"
MEDIA_URL = "https://%s/%s/" %(AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN, PUBLIC_MEDIA_LOCATION)
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "webapp.storage_backends.PublicMediaStorage"
```
# Deployment in Heroku   
 I have deployed the app in heroku and the app is in live so anyone can view it.
 You can also register your id [here](https://sainathmanagement.herokuapp.com/register)
 
 # Specification of website
  In this website the admin can manage the orders of the customer. The admin page has many specification such as update, delete the customer's order.
  And i have used `model` method `count()` to show number of orders- delivered, pending, total in the home page from the database. And in the customer id's page, the customer can view the number of order placed by him.  I have also used Bootstrap to style the page.

  ``` python
@login_required(login_url="login")
@admin_only
def home(request):
    
    order = Order.objects.all()
    customer = Customer.objects.all()
    total_orders = order.count()
    delivered = order.filter(status="delivered").count()
    pending = order.filter(status="pending").count()
    return render(request, "accounts/dashboard.html", {"orders": order, "customer": customer, "total_order": total_orders, "delivered": delivered, "pending": pending})
   ```
